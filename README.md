# Context-Aware_Conversational_Chatbot_using_Retrieval_Augmented_Generation
Built a context-aware conversational chatbot leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Google Gemini, LangChain, and Chroma. The system supports multi-turn dialogue through session-based memory, dynamically ingests and embeds documents, and delivers accurate responses with reduced latency.
